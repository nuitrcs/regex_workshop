# Regular Expressions Workshop


This is a multi-part workshop covering the basics of regular expressions.  The first parts of the workshop are relevant across languages.  There are also R and Python sessions covering the details of using regular expressions in those languages.

## Files

There is nothing to download for the initial sessions.  Follow the links below.  Exercises are also run in your web browser.  These tutorials are not language-specific -- they cover general concepts of regular expressions that can be used across programming languages.
