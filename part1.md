These materials are for the first part of the regular expression workshop.

## What are regular expressions?

Regular expressions are patterns we can use to search text.  These patterns are built using a special syntax that allows us to express different concepts, such as character classes, repetition, and the beginning and end of text.  This syntax can vary across different implementations of regular expressions (in different programming languages), but there are some common components.  

Regular expression is often shortened to regex (say: reg-ex).  

### Why use regular expressions?

Regular expressions let us extract information from text or change text when 1) there is some structure, but 2) the specific content may vary.  

For example, if we're working with tweets:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Looking for <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/EarthDay?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#EarthDay</a> fun? Look no further!<br><br>Register for our all-day event: <a href="https://t.co/OVnjNU2ZXb">https://t.co/OVnjNU2ZXb</a><br><br>Set a reminder to watch on <a href="https://t.co/z1RgZwQkWS">https://t.co/z1RgZwQkWS</a>:<br>üõ∞Ô∏è 11am ET - Q&amp;A with astronauts in space, hosted by <a href="https://twitter.com/ShawnMendes?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@ShawnMendes</a><br>üå≥ 3pm ET - <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NASAScience?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#NASAScience</a> Live Q&amp;A with <a href="https://twitter.com/NASAClimate?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@NASAClimate</a> experts <a href="https://t.co/B6WnYYHcBl">pic.twitter.com/B6WnYYHcBl</a></p>&mdash; NASA (@NASA) <a href="https://twitter.com/NASA/status/1385241483201110016?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 22, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 

How do we get the links or hash tags out?  We know there are links and hash tags.  We can identify them with `@` or `#`, which provides some structure.  But the content (the specific link or hash tag) differs.

The data we're going to work with is copied from a [list of astronauts from Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_space_travelers_by_name
):

How do we get this into a format that we could use?

## Concept 1: Fixed Matches

## Concept 2: Match Anything

## Concept 3: Character Classes

## Concept 4: Predefined Character Classes

## Concept 5: Repetition
